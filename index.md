### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

Lab 12, part 1 was our first animation and by far my absolute favorite lab. It was interesting to use a formula in order to create an animation GIF. Taking a red, green and blue image to create a single animation with each color was a lot of fun and showed the lighter side of coding. 

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 1 was the pattern with loops lab and I really enjoyed figuring out how loops fit together to make a pattern. Being able to use a simple code to create a pattern that flows perfectly was awesome to see and interesting to debug when the code didnâ€™t work the first time.

* Lab 9

Lab 9, part 1 was the Olympic judge average and one of the more challenging labs for myself. Having to create an algorithm to calculate the average of three scores was a lot of trial and error for myself and my partner. It took us a few tries but we were eventually able to figure out the correct function and made this lab extremely rewarding when it was finished.
